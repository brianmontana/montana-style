Montana's Sass Style Guide


The goal of this project is to create a custom style guide for personal projects that can focus on component design. I investigate animation, color, context, layout, responsive presentation and variety of other features that help convey a completed representation of the design fragments used for a site, application or software.

The foundation of this project started while exploring Google's Web Starter Kit and Guil Hernandez's Sass tutorials for advanced techniques.
